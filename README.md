# library

---------------------------------------

In a previous unfinished version of the library page, I used a div for the form the prevent it from refreshing the page upon submitting. In this version I use an actual form element and use Javascript to prevent the form from submitting. In this way, I will maintain proper HTML syntax, and the application itself will be easier to integrate into backend processes.
